            Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience without being explicitly programmed. The field encompasses various approaches including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Key concepts include training data, feature extraction, model selection, and performance evaluation. Applications range from image recognition and natural language processing to recommendation systems and autonomous vehicles.

            Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers: input layer, hidden layers, and output layer. Deep learning refers to neural networks with multiple hidden layers, enabling them to learn complex patterns and representations. Key components include activation functions, backpropagation algorithm, gradient descent optimization, and regularization techniques. Common architectures include feedforward networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
